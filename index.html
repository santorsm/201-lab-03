      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in New Rochelle, NY; the oldest of three boys. While my brothers remained in NY with the rest of my family, the US Air Force brought me out West, provided me an education, a means to take advantage of significant travel opportunities, and to meet my wife, Angela. We're currently living the empty-nest lifestyle in Seattle. In our free time, we enjoy spending time outdoors with our two indefatigable dogs (a golden retriever and german shepherd).</p>
