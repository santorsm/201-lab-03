## Reflections and Comments
- An interesting project. A good introduction and exposure. 
- Ensure to align on code boundaries and expectations for items not explictly stated
- I can improve on reaching out to ensure alignment on deliverable - qui tacet consentit may not be the case; Glad I've been reading up on my Wittgenstein!
- Need to do a better job time-boxing - I've now installed a timer to do a better job of holding myself accountable going forward
