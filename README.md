## Reflections and Comments
- An interesting project. A good introduction and exposure. 
- Ensure to align on code boundaries and expectations for items not explictly stated
- I can improve on reaching out to ensure alignment on deliverable - qui tacet consentit may not be the case; Glad I've been reading up on my Wittgenstein!
- **Need to do a better job time-boxing - I've now installed a timer to do a better job of holding myself accountable going forward**
- Unclear on the naming & saving convention. Shouldn't be an issue but has led to some unintended confusion on my part. I will ensure to query going forward
- **Need to get a better understanding of the git concepts**
- Unable to duplicate the `NaN` the TA had given in feedback
